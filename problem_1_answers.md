<ol>
	<li>
		<!-- What does the colspan="3" attribute of the <th> node do? -->
		Colspan forces the table header box to span the indicated number of columns, in this case, 3 (in accordance to our three columns of Rank, State and Rate). 
	</li>
	<li>Attributes of "Rank" element:
		<!-- List all the styles (e.g. border width, text alignment, etc.) applied to the th element containing "Rank". For each, state whether they are set as an HTML attribute or a CSS style and describe them in a few words. Include only styles directly applied to the element, not styles inherited/cascading from parent elements or styles from the default user agent stylesheet. Exclude overwritten styles. For HTML attributes, state the CSS equivalent.-->
		<ul>
			<li><strong>text-align</strong>: -webkit- center. This horizontally aligns the text within the element to the center. Set in HTML as "align"; CSS equivalent is "text-align".</li>
			<li><strong>padding</strong>: 3px.  This applies padding to the element box of 3px on all sides on the element border interior (within the element's dimensions), and acts as a buffer between the element borders and contained text or other content. Set in CSS as "padding".
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<!-- What differences do you notice between the DOM inspector and the HTML source? Why would you use the DOM inspector? Why is the HTML source useful? -->
		HTML source is searchable and copyable, and contains directly applied HTML properties. DOM inspector is formatted by  collapsable sections, and includes information about HTML and CSS (including inherited properties) for each element, as well as links to its sources. Both are color-coded. I would use the DOM inspector to look at and test modifications for a page element in real-time (without refreshing), e.g. modifying an element or style. I would use the HTML source to search for elements or to copy text into a separate document.
