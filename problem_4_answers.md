	<li><!-- The domain() function is the data range upon which the scale is calculated. What does d3.selectAll("tbody tr")[0].length-1 mean? -->
		The code specifies the last index number of the array generated by taking the rank numbers of each row (i.e. each state). (Length measures the length of the array, which counts starting from zero; the domain starts counting from 0, which is why we minus 1.) It feeds it into the domain() function, which says that the domain goes from 0 to that last index number. 
	</li>
	<li><!-- Add the snippet in your code. Describe, in words, what the following function calls return: color(0), color(10) and color(150)? -->
		The increasing value of the input for color returns the background color which goes from orangish red (at 0, 10) to silver (150, off the domain so the color is forced to the domain maximum).
	</li>
	<li><!-- If the array passed to domain() was the minimum and maximum rate values, how would that change the scale? In what situations would this be appropriate? -->
		It would make the minimum color the color indicated for the minimum (i.e. orangish red in my case) and the maximum color the color indicated for the maximum. This would be appropriate if the minimum was actually zero, (i.e. the minimum) and not a relative minimum. Also, it would be appropriate if the the values represented by the colors was on a continuous scale (as in this case), and not a discrete scale.
