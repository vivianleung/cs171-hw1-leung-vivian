    <li><!-- If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table? -->
        To improve the table display to facilitate understanding of summary statistics, I would enable an option for low-to-high or high-to-low sorting mechanism for the rate. This would allow for the user to survey the minima and maxima of the data. The table could also incorporate a bar graph. Bar size would be constant (length correlating to at the maximum rate) and colored as a background color (gray, for example). The state's specific rate would be represented as a colored component of the bar. The full bar would be demarcated by a gap at the mean of the data, or at particular percentiles (quartiles, for example). The color of the bar could also be further enhanced by coloring the bars according to a color intensity scale for easier viewing of the state rate relative to the rest of the nation. 

        Apart from using a table, I would also use histogram which plotted the frequency of rates in particular bins. This would enable users to easily view the distribution of data, minimal and maximal rates (bins), and mean and mode of the data.


        A heat map of US geography may also be useful. Data would display rate of unemployment according to color intensity (such that higher rates are more intensely colored). Mouse-over of a state would display numerical rate for that state.

        Pretty tables!
        <ul>
            <li>Frequency of birth dates in a year:  graph makes it easy to visually scan for the most common dates in a given month or the most common month of a given day, and overall yearly trends. (From <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2012/05/12/how-common-is-your-birthday/">The Daily Viz</a>)

            </li>
            <li>Ideological Positions of House Party Coalitions:  visualizes general trends of republican and democratic ideologies so it's easy to glance, and also plots the average ideology. Gets the point across of general trends oer the past 50 years. Coloring and the zero-line guide are useful, though the x axis could be better formatted.(From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/07/15/how-the-house-works-or-doesnt-explained-in-1-chart/">The Washington Post / Vital Statistics</a>)

            </li>
            </li>Job Loss over Bush and Obama administrations: very compelling in showing the time trends between administrations (less loss during Obama's), color choices (and making the red a darker shade, thereby appear longer), and the choice to invert the bars to better reflect the meaning of the statistic (greater job loss means a higher positive number, but means conditions are worse, and the longer a bar points downward is also worse).
